# CoreGuardian ‚Äì Protect Your Server with Confidence

**CoreGuardian** is a lightweight yet powerful plugin designed to help protect your Minecraft server from disruptive players and malicious attacks. While no plugin can guarantee 100% protection, CoreGuardian provides a strong first line of defense and useful tools to keep your community safe.

I am Vietnamese, and I originally created this plugin for Vietnamese players. However, if you would like an English version, please don‚Äôt hesitate to send me a request, and I will work on updating the plugin.

For now, all messages and notifications are in Vietnamese, which might cause some inconvenience if you are not a Vietnamese speaker.


## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Essential Security Tools**
  CoreGuardian comes with a set of basic but effective features that make it easy for server owners to set up, configure, and manage. The commands are intuitive, user-friendly, and designed for quick access.

* **Discord Webhook Integration**
  Stay informed in real-time. CoreGuardian can send alerts directly to your Discord server when suspicious activity is detected ‚Äî such as unauthorized login attempts, name impersonation, force-op exploits, UUID/IP spoofing, and more.

* **IP Reputation Checking (IPQualityScore)**
  CoreGuardian integrates with the **IPQualityScore API** to detect and block suspicious or high-risk IP addresses before they can cause trouble. This helps prevent VPN/proxy abuse and keeps unwanted traffic out.

* **Folia Support**
  Whether you‚Äôre running a traditional Spigot/Paper setup or using the next-generation **Folia** architecture, CoreGuardian is fully compatible.

* **Multi-Proxy Compatibility**
  The plugin supports multi-port and proxy server setups such as **BungeeCord**, **Velocity**, and others, ensuring flexibility for networks of all sizes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

CoreGuardian is a strong safeguard, but it is not an absolute shield. There‚Äôs always a small chance that determined attackers may find a way through. If that happens, consider it unfortunate luck rather than a flaw in the plugin itself.

## üéØ Why Choose CoreGuardian?

If you‚Äôre looking for an easy-to-use, reliable plugin that adds an extra layer of protection to your Minecraft server while keeping you updated via Discord, CoreGuardian is the right choice.

Protect your server. Keep your players safe. Build with confidence.
